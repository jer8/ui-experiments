## task list app page

Design idea from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2492038-Task-List-App/attachments/489171).

*(Not quite sure how all these buttons work together in this todo app's UX standpoint, but nevertheless its a fun UI exercise.*

***TODO: still deciding the best way to design it with growing screen size***
